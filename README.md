# Fine-Tuning BERT for Question Answering

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for a Question Answering (QA) task. The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model was originally designed for masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. This project demonstrates how to adapt and modify the model to answer questions based on a given context.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience with fine-tuning a base version of a model from scratch and modifying it for a different task than it was originally trained on. By completing in this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and model adaptation techniques. The challenge of transforming a pre-trained model like BERT for a specialized task such as question answering provided a valuable learning opportunity.

## Learnings

The goal of this project was to learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained model and modify it for a different task than it was originally trained on. Specifically, we focused on the following:

1. **Data Preparation:** Preparing the training and test datasets in a format suitable for question answering.
2. **Model Architecture:** Customizing the BERT model to predict the start and end positions of answers within the context.
3. **Training:** Training the model over multiple epochs and monitoring performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on unseen test data and analyzing the results.

## Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - **Training and Test Sets**: Custom datasets consisting of context-question-answer triples were created. The data includes contexts from product descriptions and corresponding questions and answers.
   - **Tokenization**: The context and questions were tokenized using the `BertTokenizerFast` to generate input representations suitable for the BERT model.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - A custom model class `BertBaseForQA` was created, extending the BERT model to include linear layers for predicting the start and end positions of answers within the context.
   - Specific layers of the BERT model were frozen during training to focus on task-specific fine-tuning.

3. **Training**:
   - The model was trained using the prepared datasets, with losses calculated for start and end token predictions.
   - The training process was monitored by tracking training and test losses, as well as test accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance was evaluated by comparing predicted answers with ground truth answers in the test set.
   - The results were visualized using a loss plot, showing the progression of training and test losses over epochs.

## Results and Conclusion

The fine-tuning process showed a steady reduction in both training and test losses, indicating successful learning. The final test accuracy reached 0.484, suggesting that the model can predict the correct answer in nearly half of the cases. The results highlight the model's ability to adapt to a new task, though there remains room for improvement in accuracy and generalization.

## Future Work

To further enhance the model's performance, future efforts could include:
- Experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes.
- Employing advanced regularization techniques.
- Incorporating a more extensive and diverse dataset for training.

## Getting Started
